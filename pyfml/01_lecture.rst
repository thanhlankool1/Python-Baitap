1. Intro, interpreter, number, boolean
======================================

Introducing
-----------

- Ask everyone to introduce themselves (name, age, base, expect, and 🍻...)
- After this course,
If you want to get a job, you must try very best to be the top of the class
If you want to do homework, you just need to finish the course as
requested.

How to be a good developer
--------------------------

- English. (READ)
- Self-learning the right way
- No magic mind set.

What this course not is
-----------------------

- Python web developer: no, we teach core Python in 7 first lessons, then apply it.
- Data scientist: no, Python is just a tool for data scientist, know python does not make you a data scientist.
- Data structure & Algorithm (sorting, searching, graph...): no, this course learn Python to make thing done.
- Game developer: no, we will create one simple text-base game, but that does not mean you are game developer.

This course is about
--------------------

- Know and use all python concepts
- Use that knowledge, apply to ANY thing
- Using tools, coding like a professional programmer
- Build your profile, so you can apply for companies after the class.
- Know how to use ANY library, ready ANY python code.

Python
------

- Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.
  It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic
  data types, and classes.  Python combines remarkable power with very clear
  syntax.
- Cpython
- High level
- General-purpose: science computation, network services, webs, games, system scripting ...

Interpreter
-----------

- Prompt
- interactive mode / IDLE (M$)
- script mode

Basic Python in 5 mins
----------------------

::

  + - * / ** % name > < == != list str print help

Number
------

- int, float
- operator: ``+ - * / ** // %`` - scale the problem up
- boolean
- object and object type (type() function)
- assign variable / binding name
- print
- exception understanding
- indentation
- float precision quirk
- float rounding quirk
- modulo application: convert to binary, find even/odd, cryptography,
- minify size of problems::

  This year, 2017, is "Đinh Dậu", what is the name of 1869?

Boolean
-------

- Titled case ``True``, not ``true``
- and/or/not
- short-circuit (``True and False and 1/0``)
